## Overview

Human action recognition involves the automatic identification of actions in videos, such as walking, running, swimming, etc. In this project, we use deep learning models to classify actions from the UCF101 dataset. The approach focuses on:

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model design and training
- Evaluation and performance metrics

The UCF101 dataset, which contains 101 action categories, is used for both training and testing the model. This project aims to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or 3D CNNs for efficient temporal and spatial feature extraction from video frames.

---

## Dataset

This project uses the **UCF101 dataset**, which consists of 13,320 videos in 101 action categories, collected from YouTube. The actions range from sports and physical activities to everyday human actions.

### UCF101 Dataset Categories

The 101 categories include:
- **Sports:** Basketball, Cricket, Diving, Football, etc.
- **Human Activities:** Walking, Running, Sitting, etc.
- **Others:** Biking, Playing musical instruments, etc.

You can download the dataset from [UCF101 Dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php).

### Dataset Structure

Once downloaded and extracted, the dataset should be structured as follows:

```
UCF101/
    train/
        class_1/
            video1.mp4
            video2.mp4
            ...
        class_2/
            video1.mp4
            video2.mp4
            ...
        ...
    test/
        class_1/
            video1.mp4
            video2.mp4
            ...
        ...
```

Ensure the videos are organized by class in the `train` and `test` directories.

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Ensure that you have the UCF101 dataset downloaded and properly organized.
2. Run the training script to start training the model:

   ```
   python train.py --epochs 200 --batch_size 8 --device cuda --learning_rate 0.0001 --num_workers 4 --videos_per_class 50 --n_frames 10 --model resnet-lstm --dataset ucf101 --dataset_path <path_to_dataset>
   ```
Parameters:

--epochs (int, default: 200): Number of training epochs.
--batch_size (int, default: 8): Size of each batch during training.
--device (str, choices: ['cuda', 'cpu'], default: 'cuda'): Choose the device for training ('cuda' for GPU, 'cpu' for CPU).
--learning_rate (float, default: 0.0001): Learning rate for the optimizer.
--num_workers (int, default: 0): Number of worker processes for loading the data.
--videos_per_class (int, default: 50): Number of videos per class to use for training.
--n_frames (int, default: 10): Number of frames to extract from each video for training.
--model (str, choices: ['resnet-lstm', 'resnet-fc], default: 'resnet-lstm'): Choose the model architecture.
--dataset (str, choices: ['ucf101', 'ucf11'], default: 'ucf101'): Choose the dataset to use ('ucf101' or 'ucf11').
--dataset_path (str): Path to the folder containing the dataset. Example: <Path>/UCF101/train/....

   You can adjust the `--epochs`, `--batch_size`, and other parameters based on your machine and dataset size.

### Testing the Model

Once training is complete, open the notebook demo.ipynb to evaluate the model's performance:

This will generate accuracy metrics and visualize some test results, showing how well the model can recognize actions from the UCF101 test set.

## Model Architecture

This project uses a combination of CNNs and LSTMs (or 3D CNNs) for action recognition. Below is a brief description of the architecture:

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- **Spatial Feature Extraction:** A pre-trained CNN (such as ResNet or VGG) is used to extract spatial features from individual frames of the video.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

- **Temporal Feature Extraction:** LSTM layers capture the temporal dependencies between frames, making it possible to understand the sequence of actions.

### 3D Convolutional Networks (Optional)

- **3D CNNs:** For more advanced feature extraction, 3D CNNs can be used, where convolutions are applied over both spatial dimensions (height and width) and the temporal dimension (time).

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified actions.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows the performance of the classification for each action category.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** Used for a detailed assessment of the modelâ€™s performance across different categories.

## Results

| Model                          | Accuracy (%) |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| ResidualSE                     | 59.34        |
| TSM                            | 70.93        |
| ResNet50 + FC                  | 75.44        |
| ResNet50 + biLSTM              | 85.05        |
| Enhanced ResNet-3D             | 92.24        |

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of different architectures, with the **Enhanced ResNet-3D** model achieving the highest accuracy on the UCF101 dataset.
